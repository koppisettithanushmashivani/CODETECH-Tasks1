OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT: TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH DHT SENSOR

PROJECT: Temperature and humidity monitoring with DHT sensor
OBJECTIVE
    The objective of the "Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with DHT Sensor" project is to develop a system that can accurately measure and display environmental temperature and humidity levels in real-time using a DHT sensor, such as the DHT11 or DHT22. This project aims to acquire and process data from the sensor, provide real-time visual representation through an output device like an LCD screen or web interface, and optionally implement alert mechanisms for critical thresholds. By combining sensor interfacing with microcontroller programming, the project seeks to offer a practical and cost-effective solution for applications in environmental monitoring, home automation, and agricultural systems while providing valuable hands-on experience in electronics and coding.

INTRODUCTION:
   The "Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with DHT Sensor" project focuses on designing a system to measure and display environmental temperature and humidity in real-time using a DHT sensor, such as the DHT11 or DHT22. These sensors are cost-effective, easy to use, and widely applicable in various fields, including agriculture, home automation, and weather monitoring. Accurate and timely monitoring of temperature and humidity is crucial for maintaining indoor comfort, optimizing agricultural processes, and understanding environmental conditions.
